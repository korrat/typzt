# Store the minimum metadata necessary

Do you really need to know when a note was created? well, if you lose the
database file, and you've edited the file since you've created it, you wouldn't
know, since unix-like systems keep only the most recent modification date
stored. do you need to know when a note was last modified? er, maybe, but at
that point you can just use `ls` to find out.
