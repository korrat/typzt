# Loner Zettel

"Loner Zettel" are Zettel that don't link with any other Zettel, i.e. they have
no links and are not linked to.

Since the key idea of a Zettelkasten is making as many connections and
associations between relevant ideas as possible, loner Zettel don't contribute
much until they have other notes that link to them.
