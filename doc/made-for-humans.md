# Made for humans

`settle` is designed to be as usable to humans as possible.

Zettel don't have any sort of IDs, and are instead referenced only by their
title. Using unique IDs like other apps do would be a poor choice, since it's
*astronomically* unlikely that you'd have two notes with the same title - and
even then, it's not worth sacrificing the readability of the entire system for
one or two peculiar cases.

Moreover, [tags](./tags-and-subtags.md) and [links](./links-and-backlinks.md)
are embedded within the Zettel's contents themselves, allowing you to easily
give more context to your connections and ideas.
