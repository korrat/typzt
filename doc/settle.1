.SH NAME

settle - note manager for the Zettelkasten method
.PP
DEPRECATED MANUAL
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[I]settle\f[R] <command> [<args>]
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[I]settle\f[R] [-h | --help | -V | --version]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Settle is a Zettelkasten note manager.
All notes are written in Markdown and are stored locally.
.PP
As of v0.26.0, Settle no longer supports editing a file directly.
Therefore, you\[cq]re probably going to want to use (or write) a plugin
for your favourite editor, such as
settle.vim (https://github.com/xylous/settle.vim) for Vim and Neovim.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.TP
zettelkasten
Path to Zettelkasten
.RS
.PP
If you don\[cq]t specify an absolute path, e.g.\ \f[V]notes\f[R],
it\[cq]s assumed you want your Zettelkasten to be at
\f[V]\[ti]/notes\f[R].
You can also use paths containing environment variables or paths
starting with a tilde (\f[V]\[ti]\f[R])
.RE
.TP
template
Path to Zettel template
.RS
.PP
If empty, or if the path is invalid, then templates won\[cq]t be used.
You can use paths containing environment variables, or a leading tilde
(\f[V]\[ti]\f[R]).
.RE
.SH TEMPLATES
.PP
Template files are used when creating new Zettel.
The text they contain gets put inside said new note, replacing
variables.
.SS Placeholders
.TP
\f[V]${TITLE}\f[R]
placeholder for the actual title
.TP
\f[V]${DATE}\f[R]
replaced with the output of \f[V]date +%Y-%m-%d\f[R]

\f[R]

.SH FILES
.PP
The configuration file is at either
\f[V]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/settle/settle.yaml\f[R], if
\f[V]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[R] is set, either
\f[V]\[ti]/.config/settle/settle.yaml\f[R], by default.
.SH WILDCARDS
.PP
Settle supports two wildcards that\[cq]ll come in very handy:
.TP
\f[V]*\f[R]
matches zero or more characters
.TP
\f[V].\f[R]
matches a single character
.PP
If you want a literal `*', or a literal `.', you\[cq]ll need to escape
the character, i.e.\ `\[rs]*' or `\[rs].'.
If you want a literal backslash, you\[cq]re also going to have to escape
it, i.e.\ `\[rs]\[rs]'.
All other text is matched literally.
.SH AUTOCOMPLETION
.PP
Shell completions can be generated by the user at runtime, by using the
\f[V]compl\f[R] command.
In most cases, you\[cq]ll need to create a directory for user-defined
completions, then add \f[V]settle\f[R]\[cq]s output to it.
.PP
If you want XDG compliance, you probably know what you\[cq]re doing, so
just replace a few things here and there.
.SS bash
.PP
Add the following text to the \f[V]\[ti]/.bash_completion\f[R] file:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
for comp_file in \[ti]/.bash_completion.d/*; do
    [[ -f \[dq]${comp_file}\[dq] ]] && . \[dq]${comp_file}\[dq]
done
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And then run the following commands:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mkdir \[ti]/.bash_completion.d
settle compl bash >\[ti]/.bash_completion.d/settle
\f[R]
.fi
.SS zsh
.PP
In your terminal, run:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mkdir \[ti]/.zsh_completion.d
settle compl zsh >\[ti]/zsh_completion.d/_settle
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then add this line in your zshrc:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
fpath=(${HOME}/.zsh_completion.d $fpath)
\f[R]
.fi
.SS fish
.PP
Run the following commands:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mkdir -p \[ti]/.config/fish/completions
settle compl fish >\[ti]/.config/fish/completions/settle.fish
\f[R]
.fi
